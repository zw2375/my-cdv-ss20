#### In your own words, what does Zuboff mean by "Surveillance Capitalism"####

In Zuboff's point of view, Surveillance Capitalism is a method that commercial companies use to track every one's private experience for the market purpose. Then they use these data to predict people's preferences, decisions, and even behaviors. They constantly make changes or even construct a new mode due to these results in order to cater for people. In this way, they gain a large quantity of benefits and gradually change users' behavior and thinking as well.







#### Is there aspects of Zuboff's ideas that...

#### ...spark associations with your own exoerience?
#### ...you want to ask further questions about?


What surprises me most is her mentioning of  "When you are searching Google, Google is searching you."  Even though I know the users are being tracked all the time by the companies, I unconciously forget all about this when I am a user with all the free service are in front of me. Neitehr do I pay attetion to notice how much am I influenced by them. So this kind of expression actually make me realize that I am always thinking about this issue from an outsider's perspective.


Zuboff's words remind me of my real life experience. I think of the similar recomandation that Taobao provides me :everytime when I was trying to buy something, I would see a great quantity of similar (or even the same) products. At first, I am not satisfied with these recomandations, so I keep scrolling the page. But as I spend more and more time in this searching of products, I am exposed to the same products over and over again. And I somehow would start to think these products are beatiful as well and even end up buying them, which I would definitly buy in the first place. This is a small example of how Surveillance Capitalism analysis the data and then "go beyond that to inpluence and modify our behavior". After listening to Zuboff's words, I am thrilled to think what else they can do with all these private data that we provide to them.

Zuboff makes really good points when stressing the issue about Surveillance Capitalism. But I think much more things have to be done for solving the issue of Surveillance Capitalism . Because I don't really think there will be people who would give up all these internect services aftering being refreshed by this book. But I do believe that if more and more people start to pay attetin to this, we will make progresses and finally come up with satisfatory solutions which are able to find a balance between protecting users' privacy and collect as well as make use of data.
