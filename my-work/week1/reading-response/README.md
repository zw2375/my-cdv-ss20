## Why does Bowker say "'Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea'" ? (pp. 663)

I think raw data is oxymoron because different people can have different understanding within the same data. Just as the saying goes:"：There are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes. " However, comparing to the valuable variety appreciation of art, data should be concluded to demonstrade a phenonmenon with a complicated process of analysis instead of rediating different opinions and understanding. Thus it is a bad idea to keep the raw data for it may be misunderstood and then used wrongly.

## What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"?

Diffrent calculating results will lead to different conclusions which demonsrate some kind of phenonmenons or truths.

In the process of accounting , it's getting closer to the reality as it ‘peeling off the epiermins one by one’ which is 'shaping the reality' as mentioned in the quote.

Firstly, the relationships between **accounts and users**, **people and users** etc are not simply like one represent another, for the complicated psychology lying behind the Twitter life. Thus it's not that intergrated as users can't represent people and accounts can't represent users as well. Secondly, the notions of **active users** and so on are actually vague for people's different focuses in Twitter,thus it's really limited when defining things with just one or a few dimentions. Thirdly, Twitter data is limited for the exsitence of private accounts and tweets. Last but not least, sometimes **small data** can provide more information than big data, making Twitter data which belongs to big data restricted.

## If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.

I reckon that it's not public and free to use. You can obtain certain data is because the owners (or creators) give you the authority to read these things and you can do nothing more without futher permissions. Since there are an unimaginable numbers of things you can do with the data, the data providor may never think of things that you want to do with those data. So as this article states that making it in public doesn't mean making it be public.
