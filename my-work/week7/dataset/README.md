**Description：**
This datasets contains the physical features like height, eyes' colors as well as superpowers of superheroes.I may create a cartoon character whose physical features are decided randomly due to the data's percentages. For example, there is 69% likely that the character is male due to the data. User can also hover on the physical features(like eyes) to see other posibilities and their rates.

This datasets display the way news appears on social media and the number of users' comments on the news.A thought on the way I display the visualization: create the webside as a phone screen and the social media apps are inside it.Then the user can click to the button and see the vidualization of data.



**Title:**
