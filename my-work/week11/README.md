It can be easily seen in these articles that data is no longer only the tool to reflect the reality but more of a philosopher's stone that can change the game. In Surveillance Capitalism, we learnt that companies are watching our data carefully, seeking for any benefits derive from it. But when data is involved in politics, things are a bit different but the same terrifying.

Compared to the Surveillance Capitalism, making data a tool in political control scares people of the weakened sense of democracy. Even though they still have the right to vote freely, but the choice has lost the meaning to some extent. I am really not a fan of politic, but it still strikes me that if these politicians can use the data in Facebook without users' consent during election, then they can do much more after getting the position they want.

But these things didn't arouse much attention as it should be. I think it's because the power of data is less oblivious than other transforming technologies. People may not notice and even if they notice, they may not believe that what they post in Facebook can be used to change their political standings. They are leaded to believe that they made their choices independently.

The most terrifying thing revealed in this issue is that when data is circulating between companies, between government and companies, every aspects of users’ lives can be integrated into a completed one. And people would still have no idea who they should blame for since they all have the reasonable claims: “academic purposes” “listed in the user agreement”…
