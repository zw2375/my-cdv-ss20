#### In your own words, what does Zuboff mean by "Surveillance Capitalism"####

In Zuboff's point of view, Surveillance Capitalism is a method that commercial companies use to track every one's private experience for a market purpose. Then they uses these data to predict people's preferences, decisions, and even behaviors. They constantly make changes or even construct a new mode due to these results in order to cater for people. In this way, they gain a large quantity of benefits and gradually change users' behavior and thinking as well.

What surprises me most is her mentioning of  "When you are searching Google, Google is searching you."  Even though I know the users are being tracked all the time by the companies, I unconciously forget all about this when I am a user with all the free service in front of me. So this kind of expression actually make me realize that I am always thinking about this issue as an outsider.

Zuboff's words remind me of my real life experience. I think of the similar recomandation that Taobao provides me :everytime when I was trying to buy something, I would see a great quantity of similar (or even the same) products. At first, I am not satisfied with these recomandations, so I keep scrolling the page. But as I spend more and more time in this searching of products, I am exposed to the same products over and over again. And I somehow would start to think these products are beatiful as well and even end up buying them, which I would definitly buy in the first place. This is a small example of how Surveillance Capitalism use the data and then gradually change user's thoughts. After listening to Zuboff's words, I am thrilled to think what else they can do with all these private data that we provide to them.
