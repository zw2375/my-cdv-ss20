I wanted to make my file cooler but failed to.
I failed to adjust the flex-direction since the className didn't work.
So I made the body's flex-direction row.
But then I failed to set the width limit so squares only take up one line in
the page.
Also not quite sure why it should be document.body.apppendChild instead of square.appendChild.
During my time working on this program, I came across lots of problems and managed to fix most of them. Even though it took my a really long time to do that,but I learned a lot by myself. : A good learning experience. :D
